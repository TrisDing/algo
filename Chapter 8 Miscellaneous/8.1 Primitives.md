# Primitives

## Twos Complement
```py
-8 4 2 1
[1 0 0 0]  -8
[1 0 0 1]  -7
[1 0 1 0]  -6
[1 0 1 1]  -5
[1 1 0 0]  -4
[1 1 0 1]  -3
[1 1 1 0]  -2
[1 1 1 1]  -1
[0 0 0 0]   0
[0 0 0 1]   1
[0 0 1 0]   2
[0 0 1 1]   3
[0 1 0 0]   4
[0 1 0 1]   5
[0 1 1 0]   6
[0 1 1 1]   7
```

## Convert Negative Number
```py
        [0 1 0 1]  5
Invert  [1 0 1 0]
Plus 1  [1 0 1 0] -5

        [0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]  16
Invert  [1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1]
Plus 1  [1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0] -16
```

## Bit-wise operators
```py
6 & 4       # 0110 & 0100 = 0100 (4)                     AND
1 | 2       # 0001 | 0010 = 0011 (3)                     OR
15 ^ 1      # 00001111 ^ 00000001 = 00001110 (14)        XOR
8 >> 1      # 00001000 >> 1 = 00000100 (4)               x >> y = x // 2^y
1 << 10     # 000000000001 << 10 = 010000000000 (1024)   x << y = x * 2^y
-16 >> 2    # 11110000 >> 2 = 11111100 (-4)              negative right shifting
-16 << 2    # 11110000 << 2 = 11000000 (-64)             negative left shifting
~0          # ~0000 = 1111 (-1)                          ~x = -x - 1
```

## Bit Operation Tricks
```py
x & 1 == 1        # Odd number, same as x % 2 == 1
x & 1 == 0        # Even number, same as x % 2 == 0
x >> 1            # Same as x / 2
x & 1             # Extract the last bit
(x >> k) & 1      # Extract the Kth bit
x |= 1            # Set the last bit
x |= (1 << k)     # Set the Kth bit
x ^= 1            # Flip the last bit
x ^= (1 << k)     # Flip the Kth bit
x & (x - 1)       # Drop the lowest set bit of x
x & ~(x - 1)      # Extract the lowest set bit of x
x & (-x)          # Keep the lowest set bit and sets all the other bits to 0
```
