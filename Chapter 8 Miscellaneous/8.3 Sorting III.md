## Counting Sort

Counting Sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array. The count is stored in an auxiliary array and the sorting is done by mapping the count as an index of the auxiliary array.
```py
def countingSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    res = [0] * n

    # Store the count of each elements in count array
    max_elem = max(nums)
    count = [0] * (max_elem + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        count[nums[i]] += 1

    # Store the cumulative count
    for i in range(1, max_elem + 1):
        count[i] += count[i-1]

    # Find the index of each element of the original array in count array
    # place the elements in output array
    i = n - 1
    while i >= 0:
        res[count[nums[i]] - 1] = nums[i]
        count[nums[i]] -= 1
        i -= 1

    # Copy the sorted elements into original array
    nums[:] = res[:]
    return nums
```

## Radix Sort

Radix Sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by first grouping the individual digits of the same place value. Then, sort the elements according to their increasing/decreasing order.
```py
def radixSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    # Get maximum element
    max_elem = max(nums)

    # Apply counting sort to sort elements based on place value.
    place = 1
    while max_elem // place > 0:
        countSort(place)
        place *= 10

    return nums
```

## Bucket Sort

Bucket Sort is a sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted array elements into several groups called buckets. Each bucket is then sorted by using any of the suitable sorting algorithms or recursively applying the same bucket algorithm. Finally, the sorted buckets are combined to form a final sorted array.
```py
def bucketSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    # Find maximum value in the list and use length of the list to determine
    # which value in the list goes into which bucket
    maxValue = max(nums)
    size = maxValue / n

    # Create empty buckets
    bucket = [[] for i in range(n)]

    # Put list elements into different buckets based on the size
    for i in range(n):
        j = int(nums[i] / size)
        if j != n:
            bucket[j].append(nums[i])
        else:
            bucket[n-1].append(nums[i])

    # Sort the elements of each bucket
    for i in range(n):
        bucket[i] = sorted(bucket[i])

    # Concatenate buckets with sorted elements into a single list
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        res += bucket[i]

    return res
```
