# 8.1 System Design I - A Step by Step Guide

## 1. Requirement Clarifications

- Define System Scope
    - Clarify what parts of system to focus on
    - Who uses the system? (users? developer? analyst?)
    - Who generates data (user? developer? third party?)
- Functional Requirements
    - From an end user perspective
    - Cover all key stake holders
    - Define what are not in scope
- None Functional Requirements
    - Highly Available
    - Low Latency (realtime?)
    - Data Consistency (strong consistency, eventual consistency)
    - Highly Reliable (no data loss)

## 2. Capacity Estimation

- User Estimates
    - total Users (500M)
    - daily active users (1M)
- Traffic/Bandwidth Estimates
    - number of *entities* generated per month (writes)
    - transactions per second (TPS)
    - read/write ratio (100:1)
    - queries per second (QPS)
- Storage Estimates
    - how long will the data store? (5 years? 10 years?)
    - size of each stored object
    - calculate total storage

## 3. API Design

- What type of protocol to use?  (Soap, Rest, RPC)
- List all parameters and return value
- Throttling based on users' allocated quota? (api_dev_key)

## 4. Define Data Model

- What type of database to use? (Relational, NoSQL, Graph)
- Database Schema Design

## 5. High-Level Design

- Client Module
    - Data Flow (Pull, Push, Hybrid)
    - Client Server Interaction protocol (Ajax Polling, Http Long Polling, Web Socket)
- Application Servers
    - Metadata Server
    - Block Server
    - Connection Manager
    - In Memory Key Value Cache
- Data Storages
    - Metadata Storage (users, entities)
        - Relational (Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
        - Key Value Store (Redis, Memcached, Aerospike)
        - Document Based (MongoDB, RethinkDB, CouchDB)
        - Distributed Wide Column (Cassandra, Scylla, HBase, BigTable, CosmosDB, DynamoDB)
        - Graph (Neo4j)
    - Object Storage (files, images, videos)
        - Distributed file storage (HDFS, S3)

## 6. Detailed Component Design

- Data
    - Data Structure (Trie, Queue, etc.)
    - Data Replication for Fault Tolerance (Vertical, Range Based, Hash Based)
    - Data Partitioning (Sharding based on user_id? entity_id? creation_date?)
    - Data De-duplication (Find duplicated data chunks, Post-process? or Inline?)
    - Data Aggregation (realtime? offline pre-generate data for fast retrieval)
- Services
    - Key Generation Service (pre generate keys instead of realtime hashing)
    - Synchronization Service (Sync server changes to multiple clients)
    - Indexing Service (faster random lookups, decrease write performance)
    - Monitoring Service
    - Location Service
    - Ranking Service
- Components:
    - Web Servers (reverse proxy)
    - Load Balancer (Server/Client, Server/DB, Server/Cache)
    - Cache (20/80 rule? LRU?)
    - Security and Permissions (public/private, HTTP 401)
    - Message Queue

## 7. Identify and Resolve Bottleneck

- Do we have Single point of failure? how to mitigate it?
- Do we have replicas of the data?
- Do we have Failover services available?
- How to handle "hot" users?
- How to monitor the performance of our service? Do we get fail alerts?
