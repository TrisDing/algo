# String

> In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.

## String Operations
```py
s.strip([chars])     # return a copy of the string with the leading and trailing characters removed.
s.startswith(prefix) # return True if string starts with the prefix, False otherwise.
s.endswith(prefix)   # return True if string starts with the prefix, False otherwise.
s.slipt(delimiter)   # return a list of the words of the string s.
s.lower()            # return a copy of the string with all the lowercase characters
s.upper()            # return a copy of the string with all the uppercase characters
ord(c)               # the unicode code representation of the char
ord(c) - ord('a')    # the position of the char in 26 letters
chr(i)               # string representation of the char unicode code
```

## String Constants
```py
import string

string.digits          # the string '0123456789'
string.hexdigits       # the string '0123456789abcdefABCDEF'
string.octdigits       # the string '01234567'
string.ascii_lowercase # the uppercase letters 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
string.ascii_letters   # The lowercase letters 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
string.letters         # The concatenation of the ascii_lowercase and ascii_uppercase
```

## Reverse String
```py
def reverse(s):
    if not s:
        return s

    s = list(s)

    # Classic Two Pointers
    i, j = 0, len(s)-1
    while i < j:
        s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
        i += 1
        j -= 1

    return "".join(s)
```

## Sliding Window (Single)
```py
import collections

def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    """
    Longest substring without repeating characters.
    """
    window = collections.Counter()
    maxLen = 0

    l = r = 0
    while r < n:
        c = s[r] # c is the element to be inserted into the window
        window[c] += 1 # insert c into the window
        r += 1 # expand the current window until it is no longer valid

        # shrink the window until it is valid again
        while window[c] > 1: # Do we have repeating characters?
            d = s[l] # c is the element to be removed from the window
            window[d] -= 1 # remove d from the window
            l += 1 # shrink the current window

        maxLen = max(maxLen, r-l) # r-l is the size of the current window

    return maxLen
```

## Sliding Window (Target string)
```py
import collections
import math

def minWindow(s, t):
    """
    Minimum window substring of 's' that contains 't' (including duplicates)
    """
    window = collections.Counter()
    target = collections.Counter(t)

    valid = 0
    start, length = 0, math.inf

    l = r = 0
    while r < len(s):
        c = s[r] # c is the element to be inserted into the window
        if c in target: # c is in target
            window[c] += 1 # insert c into the window
            if window[c] == target[c]: # does window contains all occurrences of c?
                valid += 1
        r += 1 # expand the current window until it is no longer valid

        # shrink the window until it is valid again
        while valid == len(target):
            # check the answer or update the result
            if (r-l) < length:
                start, length = l, r-l # remember the current window

            d = s[l] # d is the element to be removed from the window
            if d in target: # d is in target
                if window[d] == target[d]: # does window contains all occurrences of d?
                    valid -= 1
                window[d] -= 1 # remove d from the window
            l += 1  # shrink the current window

    return "" if length == math.inf else s[start: start + length]
```
