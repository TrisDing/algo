# Sliding Window

> Sliding Window is a coding technique that's designed to transform two nested loops into a single loop. It applies to arrays, lists or strings. These problems are often to be solved using a brute force approach in `O(n²)` or `O(n³)`. However, the sliding window technique can reduce the time complexity to `O(n)`.

- The problem will be based on an array, list or string type of data structure.
- It will ask to find sub-ranges in that array to give the longest, shortest or target values of a string.
- Its concept is mainly based on ideas like the longest sequence or shortest sequence of something that satisfies a given condition perfectly.

## Single Sliding Window

```py
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    """
    Longest substring without repeating characters.
    """
    window = collections.Counter()
    maxLen = 0

    l = r = 0
    while r < n:
        c = s[r] # c is the element to be inserted into the window
        window[c] += 1 # insert c into the window
        r += 1 # expand the current window until it is no longer valid

        # shrink the window until it is valid again
        while window[c] > 1: # Do we have repeating characters?
            d = s[l] # d is the element to be removed from the window
            window[d] -= 1 # remove d from the window
            l += 1 # shrink the current window

        maxLen = max(maxLen, r-l) # r-l is the size of the current window

    return maxLen
```

## Finding Target string

```py
def minWindow(s, t):
    """
    Minimum window substring of 's' that contains 't' (including duplicates)
    """
    window = collections.Counter()
    target = collections.Counter(t)

    valid = 0
    start, length = 0, math.inf

    l = r = 0
    while r < len(s):
        c = s[r] # c is the element to be inserted into the window
        if c in target: # c is in target
            window[c] += 1 # insert c into the window
            if window[c] == target[c]: # does window contains all occurrences of c?
                valid += 1
        r += 1 # expand the current window until it is no longer valid

        # shrink the window until it is valid again
        while valid == len(target):
            # check the answer or update the result
            if (r-l) < length:
                start, length = l, r-l # remember the current window

            d = s[l] # d is the element to be removed from the window
            if d in target: # d is in target
                if window[d] == target[d]: # does window contains all occurrences of d?
                    valid -= 1
                window[d] -= 1 # remove d from the window
            l += 1  # shrink the current window

    return "" if length == math.inf else s[start: start + length]
```
