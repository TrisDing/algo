# Self-balancing Binary Search Tree

> A self-balancing (or height-balanced) BST is any node-based BST that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.

## AVL Tree

> In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, re-balancing is done to restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time in both the average and worst cases.

```py
BalanceFactor(node) = Height(RightSubtree(node)) - Height(LeftSubtree(node))
BalanceFactor(node) = {-1, 0, 1}
```

4 Types of Rotations
```
Left-Left Case, right rotation:

    A (-2)      B (0)
   /          /   \
  B (-1)     C (0) A (0)
 /
C (0)

Right Right Case, left rotation:

A (2)           B (0)
 \            /   \
  B (1)      A (0) C (0)
   \
    C (0)

Left-Right Case, right rotation -> left rotation:

  A (-2)       A (-2)      C (0)
 /            /          /   \
B (1)        C (-1)     B (0) A (0)
 \          /
  C (0)    B (0)

Right-Left Case, left rotation -> right rotation:

A (-2)      A (-2)         C (0)
 \           \           /   \
  B (-1)      C (-1)    A (0) B (0)
 /             \
C (0)           B (0)
```

## Red-Black Tree

> In a redâ€“black tree, each node stores an extra bit representing color, used to ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced during insertions and deletions.

Properties
- Every node is either red or black.
- The root is black.
- All leaves (NIL) are black.
- Red nodes have only black children (no two red nodes are connected)
- Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes goes through the same number of black nodes.

Operations
1. Change Color
2. Rotate Left
3. Rotate Right

```
     G     G - Grand Parent
   /   \
  P     U  P - Parent, U - Uncle
 / \
S   N      S - Sibling, N - Current
```

Red-Black repair procedure Operations:
- All newly inserted nodes are considered as **RED** by default
- Case 1: current node N is root
    - set current node N to **BLACK**
- Case 2: current node N's parent node P is **BLACK**
    - Do Nothing since tree is still valid
- Case 3: current node N's parent node P is **RED** and it's Uncle node U is also **RED**
    - set parent node P to **BLACK**
    - set Uncle node U to **BLACK**
    - set Grand parent node G to **RED**
    - rerun on the RED-BLACK repair procedure G
- Case 4: current node N's parent node P is **RED** but it's uncle node U is **BLACK**
    - Current node N is right sub-tree, rotate left parent node P
    - current node N is left sub-tree
        - Set parent node P to **BLACK**
        - Set grand parent node G to **RED**
        - Rotate right on grand parent node G

| AVL Tree       | strictly balanced, efficient search     | need to re-balance on every insert and delete      |
| Red-Black Tree | low maintenance for insert and delete   | not strictly balanced, double the height (2*log2n) |
