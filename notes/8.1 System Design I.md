# 8.1 System Design I - A Step by Step Guide

## 1. Requirement Clarifications

- Ask Questions! Define System Scope.
- Clarify what parts of system to focus on
- Functional Requirements
    - From an end user perspective
- None Functional Requirements
    - Highly Available
    - Acceptable Latency (realtime?)
    - Data Consistency
    - Highly Reliable (no data lost)

## 2. Capacity Estimation

- User Estimates
    - total Users (500M)
    - daily active users (1M)
- Traffic/Bandwidth Estimates
    - read/write ratio (100:1)
    - number of *entities* generated per month (writes)
    - transaction per second (TPS)
- Storage Estimates
    - how long will the data store? (5 years? 10 years?)
    - size of each stored object
    - calculate total storage

## 3. API Design

- Add __api_dev_key__ in API can help throttle users based on their allocated quota
- Explain what an API will return

## 4. Define Data Model

- What type of database to use? Relational? NoSQL?
- Database Schemas
- Metadata Storage (users, entities)
- Object Storage (files, images, videos)

## 5. High-Level Design

- Client Module
- Web Servers (reverse proxy)
- Application Servers
- Databases
- Load Balancer
- Cache

## 6. Detailed Component Design

- Data
    - Data Partitioning (Sharding based on user_id? entity_id? creation_date?)
    - Data Flow (Pull? Push? or Hybrid?)
    - Data Replication (Vertical? Range Based? or Hash Based?)
    - Data De-duplication (Find duplicated data chunks, Post-process? or Inline?)
    - Data Aggregation (realtime? offline pre-generate data for fast retrieval)
- Services
    - Key Generation Service (pre generate keys instead of realtime hashing)
    - Synchronization Service (Sync server changes to multiple clients)
    - Indexing Service
    - Monitoring Service
    - Location Service
- Components:
    - Cache (20/80 rule? LRU?)
    - Load Balancer (Server/Client, Server/DB, Server/Cache)
    - Security and Permissions (public/private, HTTP 401)
    - Message Queue

## 7. Identify and Resolve Bottleneck

- Do we have Single point of failure? how to mitigate it?
- Do we have replicas of the data?
- Do we have Failover services available?
- How to handle "hot" users?
- How to monitoring the performance of our service? Do we get fail alerts?
