# Sorting I - Simple Sorts

How to Evaluate a Sorting Algorithm

- Time Efficiency
    - Best case, worst case, average case time complexity
    - Consider the coefficients and constants in the time complexity when data set is small
    - Number of comparisons and number of moves
- Space Efficiency
    - When a sorting algorithm's space complexity is O(1), we call that _"in-place sort"_.
- Stability
    - stable sort: the sequence of two equal elements stay unchanged before and after sorting.
    - unstable sort: the sequence of two equal elements is changed after sorting.

| Shell Sort     | O(nlogn)  | O(n^2)   | O(nlogn) | O(1)      | NO        |

## Bubble Sort

Compares two adjacent elements and swaps them if they are not in the intended order.
```py
def BubbleSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n-1):
        swapped = False

        for j in range(n-1-i):
            if nums[j] > nums[j+1]:
                nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]
                swapped = True

        if not swapped:
            break

    return nums
```

## Insertion Sort

Places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
```py
def InsertionSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(1, n):
        key = nums[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and nums[j] > key:
            nums[j+1] = nums[j]
            j -= 1
        nums[j+1] = key

    return nums
```

## Selection Sort

Selects the smallest element from an unsorted list in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted list.
```py
def SelectionSort(nums):
    n = len(nums)

    for i in range(n-1):
        min_j = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if nums[j] < nums[min_j]:
                min_j = j
        nums[i], nums[min_j] = nums[min_j], nums[i]

    return nums
```

## Shell Sort

Shell sort is a generalized version of the insertion sort algorithm. It first sorts elements that are far apart from each other and successively reduces the interval between the elements to be sorted. The interval between the elements is reduced based on the sequence used, for example: `n/2, n/4, n/8, ..., 1`
```
shellSort(array, size)
  for interval i <- size/2n down to 1
    for each interval "i" in array
        sort all the elements at interval "i"
end shellSort
```
