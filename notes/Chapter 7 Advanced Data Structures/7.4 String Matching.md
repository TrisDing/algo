## BF (Brute Force)

> Naive matching algorithm slides the pattern over text one by one and check for a match. If a match is found, then slides by 1 again to check for subsequent matches.

```
text = b a a b c f
pattern = a b c

n = len(text) = 6
m = len(pattern) = 3
We need to compare (n - m + 1) = 4 times

i=0
b a a b c f  Match? NO.
a b c        Slide >> 1

  i=1
b a a b c f  Match? NO.
  a b c      Slide >> 1

    i=2
b a a b c f  Match? YES.
    a b c    Slide >> 1

      i=3
b a a b c f  Match? YES.
      a b c
```

```py
def BruteForce(pattern, text):
    m, n = len(pattern), len(text)

    for i in range(n-m+1): # need to compare n-m+1 times
        j = 0

        # For current index i, check for pattern match
        while(j < m):
            if (text[i + j] != pattern[j]):
                break
            j += 1

        if (j == m):
            print("Pattern found at position ", i)
```

## RK (Rabin-Karp)

> Rabin-Karp algorithm is an algorithm used for searching/matching patterns in the text using a hash function. Unlike Naive string matching algorithm, it does not travel through every character in the initial phase rather it filters the characters that do not match and then performs the comparison.

```
text = b a a b c f
pattern = a b c

n = len(text) = 6
m = len(pattern) = 3
We need to calculate (n - m + 1) = 4 hash values

b a a b c f
b a a - - - -> hash 1
  a a b - - -> hash 2
    a b c - -> hash 3
      b c f -> hash 4
```

Let's say we only consider lowercase alpha characters (a-z).
```
a b c d e f g h i  j  k  l  m  n  o  p  q  r  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26
```

First, calculate hash value for the pattern
```
a b c
1 2 3

hash(abc) = (1 * 26^2 + 2 * 26^1 + 3 * 26^0) mod 26 = 3
```

Then, first each substring within the text
```
b a a b c f
2 1 1 2 3 6

hash(baa) = (2 * 26^2 + 1 * 26^1 + 1 * 26^0) mod 26 = 1
hash(aab) = (1 * 26^2 + 1 * 26^1 + 2 * 26^0) mod 26 = 2
hash(abc) = (1 * 26^2 + 2 * 26^1 + 3 * 26^0) mod 26 = 3
hash(bcf) = (2 * 26^2 + 3 * 26^1 + 6 * 26^0) mod 26 = 6

For a finite character set, we can pre-calculate the power of 26

0  1
1  26
2  676
3  17576
......

We can also optimize this process by make use of the previous hash value in the following way.

t = ((d * (t - v[character to be removed] * h) + v[character to be added]) mod 26
```

Finally, compare the pattern string with the substring by hash values. If the two hashes ​​are equal, then the substring _should_ match the pattern string. However, when there is a hash conflict (the hash values ​​of the substring and the pattern string are the same but they do not match), we compare the substring with the pattern string again by the text. On the other hand, if the hash value of the substring and the pattern string does not equal, the substring and pattern string _must_ not match.

```py
d = 26

def RabinKarp(pattern, text, q):
    m = len(pattern)
    n = len(text)
    p = 0
    t = 0
    h = 1
    i = 0
    j = 0

    for i in range(m-1):
        h = (h*d) % q

    # Calculate hash value for pattern and text
    for i in range(m):
        p = (d*p + ord(pattern[i])) % q
        t = (d*t + ord(text[i])) % q

    # Find the match
    for i in range(n-m+1): # still need to compare n-m+1 times
        if p == t:
            for j in range(m):
                if text[i+j] != pattern[j]:
                    break

            j += 1
            if j == m:
                print("Pattern is found at position: " + str(i+1))

        if i < n-m:
            t = (d*(t-ord(text[i])*h) + ord(text[i+m])) % q

            if t < 0:
                t = t+q
```

## BM (Boyer-Moore)

> The Boyer–Moore algorithm searches for occurrences of the pattern string in the text by performing explicit character comparisons at different alignments. Instead of a brute-force search of all alignments (of which there are m-n+1), Boyer–Moore uses information gained by preprocessing pattern to skip as many alignments as possible.

```
Naive:

a b c a c a b d c
a b d               Match? NO.
  a b d             slide 1
matching direction --->

BM:

a b c a c a b d c
a b d               Match? NO.
      a b d         slide 3
<---- matching direction
```

The bad character rule
```
 a  b (c) a c a b d c
 a  b  d               "c" cannot match any character in the pattern string
          a b d        slide to avoid "c"
```

The good suffix rule
```
a  b  c  a  c  a [b c] b
a  b [b  c] a              "bc" is the good suffix
            a  b [b c] a   slide to match "bc"
```

## KMP (Knuth–Morris–Pratt)

> The KMP algorithm searches for occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

## Aho-Corasick (AC State Machine)

> The AC algorithm constructs a finite-state machine that resembles a _trie_ with additional links between the various internal nodes. These extra internal links allow fast transitions between failed string matches (e.g. a search for `cat` in a trie that does not contain `cat`, but contains `cart`, and thus would fail at the node prefixed by `ca`), to other branches of the trie that share a common prefix (e.g., in the previous case, a branch for attribute might be the best lateral transition). This allows the automaton to transition between string matches without the need for backtracking.
