# Recursion Tree

## Merge Sort

The merge operation takes `O(n)` time so the total time complexity of Merge Sort is `O(h * n)`. Since this is a full binary tree, `h = log(n)`, so the total time complexity of Merge Sort is `O(n*log(n))`
```py
                 __________f(n)_________                 ... n
                /                       \
         ___f(n/2)___              ___f(n/2)___          ... n/2+n/2=n
        /            \            /            \
     f(n/4)        f(n/4)        f(n/4)       f(n/4)     ... n/4+n/4+n/4+n/4=n
    /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
 f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) ... n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8=n
```

## Quick Sort

Unlike merge sort, quick sort does not necessarily divide data into 2 halves. Let's assume we partition ratio is `1:9` (e.g. left array gets 1 element, right array gets 9 elements). The total number of traversed data is between `[n*log10(n), n*log9/10(n)]`, so the time complexity Quick Sort is still `O(n*log(n))`.

```py
                       _____________________f(n)___________________
                      /                                            \
            ______f(n/10)______                          _________f(9n/10)________
           /                   \                        /                         \
      f(n/10^2)            f(9n/10^2)              f(9n/10^2)                f(9^2n/10^2)
     /         \           /         \             /        \               /           \
 f(n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9^3n/10^3)


n,  n/10,    n/10^2,    n/10^3, ... 1 -> shortest path h = log10(n)
n, 9n/10, 9^2n/10^2, 9^3n/10^3, ... 1 -> longest path  h = log9/10(n)
```

## Fibonacci

The total number of traversed data is between `[2^n - 1, 2^(n/2) - 1]`, so the time complexity of Fibonacci is between `O(2^n)` and `O(2^(n/2))`.

```py
                 __________f(n)_________                 ... 1
                /                       \
         ___f(n-1)___                ___f(n-2)___        ... 2
        /            \              /            \
     f(n-2)        f(n-3)        f(n-3)       f(n-4)     ... 4
    /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
 f(n-3) f(n-4) f(n-4) f(n-5) f(n-4) f(n-5) f(n-5) f(n-6) ... 8

shortest path: 1 + 2 + ... + 2^n-1 = 2^n - 1
longest path:  1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n/2-1) = 2^(n/2) - 1
```

## Permutation

For example: Given 3 numbers `1, 2, 3`, we have the following permutation:
```
1, 2, 3
1, 3, 2
2, 1, 3
2, 3, 1
3, 1, 2
3, 2, 1
```

If the last bit of data is determined, the problem becomes the permutation of the remaining `nâˆ’1` data. The last bit of can be any number from 1 to n, so there are `n` cases for its value.
```py
          f(n)
           |
        n * f(n-1)
           |
    n * (n-1) * f(n-2)
           |
n * (n-1) * (n-2) * f(n-3)
           |
          ...
```

Therefore, the problem of `n` permutation can be decomposed into `n` sub-problems of `n-1` permutations:
```
T(n) = n + n * (n-1) + n * (n-1) * (n-2) + ... + n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 2 * 1
```
The time complexity of Permutation is between `O(n!)` and `O(n * n!)`.
