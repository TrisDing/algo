## Merge Sort
```py
                 __________f(n)_________                 ... n
                /                       \
         ___f(n/2)___              ___f(n/2)___          ... n/2+n/2=n
        /            \            /            \
     f(n/4)        f(n/4)        f(n/4)       f(n/4)     ... n/4+n/4+n/4+n/4=n
    /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
 f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) f(n/8) ... n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8+n/8=n

# The merge operation takes O(n) time so the total time complexity of Merge Sort is O(h * n). Since this is a full binary tree, h = log(n), so the total time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n * log(n))
```

### Quick Sort
```py
# Unlike merge sort, quick sort does not necessarily divide data into 2 halves. Let's assume we partition ratio is 1:9 (e.g. left array gets 1 element, right array gets 9 elements).

                       _____________________f(n)___________________
                      /                                            \
            ______f(n/10)______                          _________f(9n/10)________
           /                   \                        /                         \
      f(n/10^2)            f(9n/10^2)              f(9n/10^2)                f(9^2n/10^2)
     /         \           /         \             /        \               /           \
 f(n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9^2n/10^3) f(9^3n/10^3)


n,  n/10,    n/10^2,    n/10^3, ... 1 -> shortest path h = log10(n)
n, 9n/10, 9^2n/10^2, 9^3n/10^3, ... 1 -> longest path  h = log9/10(n)

# The total number of traversed data is between [n*log10(n), n*log9/10(n)], so the time complexity Quick Sort is still O(n log(n)).
```

### Fibonacci
```py
                 __________f(n)_________                 ... 1
                /                       \
         ___f(n-1)___                ___f(n-2)___        ... 2
        /            \              /            \
     f(n-2)        f(n-3)        f(n-3)       f(n-4)     ... 4
    /     \       /     \       /     \       /     \
 f(n-3) f(n-4) f(n-4) f(n-5) f(n-4) f(n-5) f(n-5) f(n-6) ... 8

shortest path: 1 + 2 + ... + 2^n-1 = 2^n - 1
longest path:  1 + 2 + ... + 2^(n/2-1) = 2^(n/2) - 1

# The total number of traversed data is between [2^n - 1, 2^(n/2) - 1], so the time complexity of Fibonacci is between O(2^n) and O(2^(n/2)).
```

### Permutation

For example: Given 3 numbers `1, 2, 3`, we have the following permutation:
```
1, 2, 3
1, 3, 2
2, 1, 3
2, 3, 1
3, 1, 2
3, 2, 1
```

```py
# If we determine the last bit of data, it becomes the problem of solving the permutation of the remaining nâˆ’1 data. The last bit of can be any number from n, so there are n cases for its value. Therefore, the problem of n permutation can be decomposed into n sub-problems of n-1 permutations.

          f(n)
           |
        n * f(n-1)
           |
    n * (n-1) * f(n-2)
           |
n * (n-1) * (n-2) * f(n-3)
           |
          ...

n + n*(n-1) + n*(n-1)*(n-2) + ... + n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1

# The time complexity of Permutation is between O(n!) and O(n * n!).
