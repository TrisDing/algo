# Dynamic Programming II - The Knapsack Problem

## 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

```py
def knapsack(W, weight, value):
    """
    dp[i][j] means when we put item i (or not put) into a knapsack of capacity j,
    the maximum total value currently in the knapsack.

    dp[i][j] = {
        0       , i == 0 and j <  weight[0] (not enough space to put first item)
        value[0], i == 0 and j >= weight[0] (has enough space to put first item)

        0, j == 0 (no space available)

        dp[i-1][j], i > 0 and j < weight[i] (not enough space to put item i)

        max(
            dp[i-1][j], (choose not to put item i)
            dp[i-1][j - weight[i]] + value[i] (choose to put item i)
        ), i > 0 and j >= weight[i] (has enough space to put item i)
    }
    """
    N = len(weight)

    dp = [[0] * (W+1) for _ in range(N)]

    # Initialize DP
    for i in range(N):
        dp[i][0] = 0 # no space available

    for j in range(1, W+1):
        if j < weight[0]: # not enough space to put first item
            dp[0][j] = 0
        else: # has enough space to put first item
            dp[0][j] = value[0]

    print(dp)
    """
       0  1  2  3  4
    1  0 15 15 15 15
    2  0  .  .  .  .
    3  0  .  .  .  .
    """

    for i in range(1, N):
        for j in range(1, W+1):
            if j < weight[i]: # not enough space to put item i
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] # total value is not changed
            else: # has enough space to put item i
                # make a choose: "put item i" or "not put item i", choose the max value
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j - weight[i]] + value[i])

    print(dp)
    """
       0  1  2  3  4
    1  0 15 15 15 15
    2  0 15 15 20 35
    3  0 15 15 20 35
    """

    return dp[N-1][W]

ans = knapsack(4, [1,3,4], [15,20,30])
print(ans) # 35
```

**Optimization**: Status Compression (Rolling Array)

```py
# We know that dp[i][j] only depends on its previous layer dp[i-1][j]
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j - weight[i]] + value[i])

# We can copy the values from dp[i-1][j] to dp[i][j]
dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j - weight[i]] + value[i])

# Thus the DP array can be "compressed" into one dimensional
dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - weight[i]] + value[i])

# To ensure we pick each item only once, we need to traverse j backwards from W to weight[i]
dp = [0] * (W+1)
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(W, weight[i] - 1, -1):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - weight[i]] + value[i])
```

## Complete Knapsack Problem

Given a knapsack weight W and a set of n items with certain value and weight, we need to calculate the maximum amount that could make up this quantity exactly. This is different from 0/1 Knapsack problem, here we are allowed to use unlimited number of instances of an item.

```py
dp = [0] * (W+1)
for i in range(N):
    for j in range(weight[i], W+1):
        dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - weight[i]] + value[i])
```
