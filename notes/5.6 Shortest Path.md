# Shortest Path

> Breadth-first search algorithm can only solve the “shortest path” problem in “unweighted graphs”. But in real life, we often need to find the “shortest path” in a “weighted graph”.

There are two “single source shortest path” algorithms:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (solve weighted directed graph with non-negative weights).
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** (solve weighted directed graph with any weights, including negative weights).
