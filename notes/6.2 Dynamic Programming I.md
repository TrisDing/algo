# Dynamic Programming I - DP Framework

> Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.

- **Optimal Substructure**: the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of "_recursion_".
- **Overlapping Subproblems**: the space of sub-problems must be small, that is, any recursive algorithm solving the problem should solve the same sub-problems over and over, rather than generating new sub-problems. If a problem can be solved by combining optimal solutions to non-overlapping sub-problems, the strategy is called _"divide and conquer"_ instead.

This can be achieved in either of two ways:
1. **Top-down**: Recursion + Memo
2. **Bottom-up**: Iteration + DP Table (states)

                  _______f(4)______                       _______f(3)_
                 /                 \                     /            \
        _______f(3)_             __f(2)_             __f(2)_          f(1)
       /            \           /       \           /       \
   __f(2)_          f(1)      f(1)      f(1)      f(1)      f(1)
  /       \
f(1)      f(1)
```

```py
# Recursion
def fib(N):
    if N < 2: return N
    return fib(N-1) + fib(N-2)

# Space Optimized Version (Memo)
memo = {}
def fib(N):
    if N < 2: return N
    if N not in memo:
        memo[N] = fib(N-1) + fib(N-2)
    return memo[N]
```

**Bottom-up**
```
f(0) f(1) f(2) f(3) f(4) f(5)
  1    2    3    5    8   13

```

```py
# Dynamic Programming
def fib(N):
    """
    dp(N) = {
        N, N < 2
        dp(N-1) + dp(N-2), N >= 2
    }
    """
    if N < 2: return N
    dp = [0] * (N+1)
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, N+1):
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    return dp[-1]

# Space Optimized Version (Reduce States)
def fib(self):
    if N < 2: return N
    f, f1, f2 = 0, 0, 1
    for i in range(N):
        f = f1 + f2
        f2 = f1
        f1 = f
    return f
```
