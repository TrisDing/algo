# Linked List

> A linked list is a sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data.

- linked list does not need a contiguous memory space. It connects a group of scattered memory blocks in series through _pointers_.
- The first node is called _head_. It is used to record the base address of the linked list so that we can traverse the entire linked list with it.
- The last node is called _tail_. It does not point to the next node, but to an empty address **None**.

### Singly linked list

```
head                             tail
  ⤵                              ⤴
[data][next] → [data][next] → [data][next] → None
```

```py
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
```

Insert Node
```
          curr        next
--> 10 --> 20 ---X---> 40 --> ...
            ⤷ Node(30) ⤴
```

Delete Node
```
   prev      curr      next
--> 10 --X--> 20 --X--> 30 --> ...
     ⤷ ................ ⤴
```

| Operation  | Time Complexity |
| ---------- | :-------------: |
| Access     | O(n)            |
| Search     | O(n)            |
| Insertion  | O(1)            |
| Deletion   | O(1)            |

### Circular linked list

Circular linked list is is convenient to traverse from tail to head. It's a good representation of a ring structure to solve problems like _Round Robin_ or [Josephus Problem](https://www.prepbytes.com/blog/linked-list/josephus-circle-using-circular-linked-list/).

```
head
  ⤵
[data][next] → [data][next] → [data][next]
   ↑__________________________________↓

```

### Doubly linked list

```
      head                                        tail
        ⤵                                         ⤴
[prev][data][next] ↔ [prev][data][next] ↔ [prev][data][next]
```

```py
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```

Java's [LinkedList](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/java.base/share/classes/java/util/LinkedList.java) is a doubly linked list implementation.

| Link Type     | Pros                                    | Cons                                     |
| --------------| :-------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
| Singly Linked | Use less Memory, Simpler Implementation | Cannot easily access previously elements |
| Doubly Linked | Can be traverse backwards               | takes 2x memory                          |

## Algorithms

**Sentry (Dummy Head)**
```py
dummy = ListNode(None)
dummy.next = head

prev, curr = dummy, head
while curr:
    # Do something here
    prev = curr
    curr = curr.next

return dummy.next
```

**Fast Slow Pointers**
```py
fast = slow = head
while fast and fast.next:
    # fast move 2 steps at a time
    fast = fast.next.next
    # slow move 1 step at a time
    slow = slow.next

# when num of the list is odd, slow is the mid
# when num of the list is even, slow is the first node after mid
return slow
```

**Linked List [Recursion](<./3.1 Recursion.md>)**
```py
def reverseList(head):
    # base case
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    # assume the rest of the list is already reversed
    p = self.reverseList(head.next)
    # do the current reverse step with only 2 nodes
    head.next.next = head
    head.next = None

    return p
```
