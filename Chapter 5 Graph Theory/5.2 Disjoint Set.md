# Disjoint-set (Union-find set)

> A _disjoint-set_ data structure is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine whether elements are in the same set.

```py
ds = DisjointSet(5)

(0) (1) (2) (3) (4)

ds.union(1, 2)
ds.union(3, 4)

(0) (1) (3)
     |   |
    (2) (4)
```

The main idea of a “disjoint set” is to have all connected vertices have the same parent node or root node, whether directly or indirectly connected. To check if two vertices are connected, we only need to check if they have the same root node.

## Quick Find

```py
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        # the root array stores the root node of each vertex.
        self.root = [i for i in range(size)]

    # The find function locates the root node of a given vertex.
    def find(self, x):
        return self.root[x]

    # The union function connects two previously unconnected vertices by giving
    # them the same root node.
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            for i in range(len(self.root)):
                if self.root[i] == rootY:
                    self.root[i] = rootX

    # The connected function checks the connectivity of two vertices.
    def connected(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
```

| Operation   | Time Complexity |
| ----------- | :-------------: |
| initialize  | O(n)            |
| find        | O(1)            |
| union       | O(n)            |
| connected   | O(1)            |

## Quick Union

```py
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        # the root array stores the parent node of each vertex.
        self.parents = [i for i in range(size)]

    # The find function locates the root node of a given vertex.
    def find(self, x):
        while x != self.parents[x]:
            x = self.parents[x]
        return x

    # The union function connects two previously unconnected vertices by giving
    # them the same root node.
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            self.parents[rootY] = rootX

    # The connected function checks the connectivity of two vertices.
    def connected(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
```

| Operation  | Time Complexity |
|------------|:---------------:|
| initialize |      O(1)       |
| Find       |      O(n)       |
| Union      |      O(n)       |
| Connected  |      O(n)       |

Both Find and Union operations have `O(n)` time complexity (**only in the worst-case**, that is when all the vertices form a single line). Thus _Quick Union_ is more efficient than _Quick Find_.

## Path Compression Optimization

After finding the root node, we can update the parent node of all traversed elements to their root node. When we search for the root node of the same element again, we only need to traverse two elements to find its root node, which is highly efficient.

```py
# find function optimized with path compression
def find(self, x):
    if x == self.root[x]:
        return x
    self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x])
    return self.root[x]
```

## Union by Rank

It is possible for all the vertices to form a line after connecting them using `union`, which is the **worst-case** scenario for the `find` function. We use an additional `rank` array to track the height of each vertex. When we `union` two vertices, instead of always picking the root of x (or y) as the new root node, we choose the root node of the vertex with a larger rank. We will merge the _shorter_ tree under the _taller_ tree and assign the root node of the taller tree as the root node for both vertices. In this way, we effectively avoid the possibility of connecting all vertices into a straight line.

```py
def __init__(self, n):
    self.root = [i for i in range(n)]
    # The initial "rank" of each vertex is 1, because each of them is a
    # standalone vertex with no connection to other vertices.
    self.rank = [1] * n

# union function optimized by rank
def union(self, x, y):
    rootX = self.find(x)
    rootY = self.find(y)
    if rootX != rootY:
        if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.root[rootY] = rootX
        elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
            self.root[rootX] = rootY
        else:
            self.root[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += 1
```

## Coding Template

```py
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.root = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.rank = [1] * n # optional, union by ranking
        self.group = n # optional, record how many connected vertexes

    def find(self, x):
        if x == self.root[x]:
            return x
        self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x]) # optional, path compression
        return self.root[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1
            self.group -= 1
            return True # successful connection
        return False # optional, detect cycle, x and y are already connected

    def connected(self, x, y):
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)
```

Union Find time complexity after optimization
