# Breadth-first Search (BFS)

> Breadth-first Search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.

## The Algorithm

- Pick any node, visit the adjacent unvisited vertex, mark it as visited, process it, and insert it in a queue.
- If there are no remaining adjacent vertices left, remove the first vertex from the queue.
- Repeat step 1 and step 2 until the queue is empty or the desired node is found.

```py
def bfs(node):
    queue = collections.deque([node])
    visited = set(node)

    # Loop until queue is empty
    while queue:
        # get current node from queue
        curr = queue.popleft()

        # process current node
        print(curr.val)

        # process neighbors if not visited
        for neighbour in graph[curr]:
            if neighbour not in visited:
                # add to queue
                queue.append(neighbour)
                # add to visited
                visited.add(neighbour)
        
        # post process current level
        # aggregate level results, count steps, etc.
```

## Time Complexity

Since all nodes and vertices are visited, the time complexity for BFS on a graph is `O(V + E)`; where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

## BFS Applications

### Level Order
```py
def levelOrder(root):
    queue = collections.deque([root])
    visited = set(root)
    res = []

    while queue:
        level_nodes = []
        
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            level_nodes.append(node.val)
            
            if node.children:
                for child in node.children:
                    if child not in visited:
                        visited.add(child)
                        queue.append(child)

        res.append(level_nodes)

    return res
```

### Shortest Path
```py
def shortestPath(start, target):
    queue = collections.deque([start])
    visited = set(start)
    step = 0

    while queue:
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if node == target:
                return step

            if node.children:
                for child in node.children:
                    if child not in visited:
                        queue.append(child)
                        visited.add(child)

        step += 1

    return 0 # not found
```

### Bidirectional BFS
```py
def biBfs(source, target):
    sourceQueue = collections.deque([source])
    targetQueue = collections.deque([target])
    visited = set(source)
    step = 0

    while sourceQueue and targetQueue:
        # choose the smaller queue to spread
        if len(sourceQueue) > len(targetQueue):
            sourceQueue, targetQueue = targetQueue, sourceQueue

        for _ in range(len(sourceQueue)):
            node = sourceQueue.popleft()

            # source and target meet
            if node in targetQueue:
                return step

            # process children
            if node.children:
                for child in node.children:
                    if child not in visited:
                        sourceQueue.append(child)
                        visited.add(child)
                        
        step += 1

    return 0 # not found
```

### Multi Threaded BFS
```py
from concurrent import futures
from collections import deque

def crawl(self, startUrl: str, htmlParser: 'HtmlParser') -> List[str]:
    hostname = lambda url: url.split('/')[2]
    visited = set(startUrl)

    with futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=16) as executor:
        tasks = deque([executor.submit(htmlParser.getUrls, startUrl)])
        while tasks:
            for url in tasks.popleft().result():
                if url not in visited and hostname(startUrl) == hostname(url):
                    tasks.append(executor.submit(htmlParser.getUrls, url))
                    visited.add(url)

    return list(visited)
```

## Graph Traversal

Given edges, construct graph
```py
edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]

graph = collections.defaultdict(list) # or defaultdict(set)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v) # u -> v
    graph[v].append(u) # v -> u, add this line if graph is undirected (bi-directional)

graph = { 0: [1,2], 1: [0,2], 2: [1,0] } # UDG
graph = { 0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0] } # DG
```

Given an **undirected graph** (or bidirectional graph) with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex `start` to vertex `end`.
```py
def validPath(self, n: int, graph: dict[int, list[int]], start: int, end: int) -> bool:
    queue = collections.deque([start])
    visited = set(start)

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        
        if u == end:
            return True

        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                queue.append(v)
                visited.add(v)

    return False
```

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, find all possible paths from node `start` to node `end` and return them in any order.
```py
def allPathsSourceToTarget(self, graph: dict[int, list[int]], start: int, end: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    res = []

    start_path = [start]
    queue = collections.deque([start_path])
    
    # no need to track visited node because of acyclic

    while queue:
        current_path = queue.popleft()
        
        u = current_path[-1]
        if u == end:
            res.append(current_path)
            continue
            
        for v in graph[u]:
            new_path = current_path[:]
            new_path.append(v)
            queue.append(new_path)

    return res
```

Given a directed graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, Return an array answer of length n, where each `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x`, or -1 if such a path does not exist.
```py
def lengthShortestPaths(self, n: int, graph: dict[int, set[int]], start: int, end: int) -> List[int]:
    queue = collections.deque([0])
    path_count = [math.inf] * n # node -> count
    level = -1

    while queue:
        level += 1
        
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            u = queue.popleft()
            
            path_count[u] = min(path_count[u], level)

            for v in list(graph[u]):
                graph[u].remove(v)
                queue.append(v)

    return [cnt if cnt != math.inf else -1 for cnt in path_count]
