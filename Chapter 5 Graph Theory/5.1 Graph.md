# Graph

> A _Graph_ is a finite set of **vertices** and connected by a set of **edges**.

```

```

- A collection of vertices V
- A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)
```
V = {0, 1, 2, 3}
E = {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (1,2)}
G = {V, E}
```

Types of graphs:
- **Undirected Graph**: nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional.
- **Directed Graph**: nodes are connected by directed edges â€“ they only go in one direction.
- **Weighted Graph**: a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight

## Graph Adjacency List Representation

- The size of the array is equal to the number of nodes.
- A single index, array[i] represents the list of nodes adjacent to the ith node.
```
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3#
1 -> 0 -> 2#
2 -> 0 -> 1#
3 -> 0#
```

Python Representation (A dictionary of vertices)
```py
graph = {
    '0': set(['1', '2', '3']),
    '1': set(['0', '2']),
    '2': set(['0', '1']),
    '3': set(['0'])
}
```

### Pros of Adjacency List
- An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For a sparse graph with millions of vertices and edges, this can mean a lot of saved space.
- It also helps to find all the vertices adjacent to a vertex easily.

### Cons of Adjacency List
- Finding the adjacent list is not quicker than the adjacency matrix because all the connected nodes must be first explored to find them.

```py
class AdjNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.vertex = value
        self.next = None

class UDG:
    def __init__(self, n):
        # Creates an undirected graph with n vertices [0:n]
        self.n = n
        self.graph = [None] * n

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2):
        # Adds an edge between vertex1 and vertex2
        if v1 == v2:
            print("Same vertex %d and %d" % (v1, v2))
        # v1 -> v2
        node = AdjNode(v2)
        node.next = self.graph[v1]
        self.graph[v1] = node
        # v2 -> v1
        node = AdjNode(v1)
        node.next = self.graph[v2]
        self.graph[v2] = node

    def remove_edge(self, v1, v2):
        # Removes the edge between vertex1 and vertex2
        node1, node2 = self.graph[v1], self.graph[v2]
        if not node1 or not node2:
            print("No edge between %d and %d" % (v1, v2))
            return
        self.graph[v1] = self.delete_node(node1, v2)
        self.graph[v2] = self.delete_node(node2, v1)

    # remove_edge helper
    def delete_node(self, head, vertex):
        # Deletes node from a linked list
        dummy, dummy.next = AdjNode(-1), head
        prev, curr = dummy, head
        while curr:
            if curr.vertex == vertex:
                prev.next = curr.next
            else:
                prev = curr
            curr = curr.next
        return dummy.next

    def print_graph(self):
        for i in range(self.n):
            print("Vertex " + str(i) + ":", end="")
            node = self.graph[i]
            while node:
                print(" -> {}".format(node.vertex), end="")
                node = node.next
            print(" \n")

g = UDG(4)
g.print_graph()
# Vertex 0: 
# Vertex 1: 
# Vertex 2: 
# Vertex 3: 

g.add_edge(0,1)
g.add_edge(0,2)
g.add_edge(0,3)
g.add_edge(1,2)
g.print_graph()
# Vertex 0: -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 
# Vertex 1: -> 2 -> 0 
# Vertex 2: -> 1 -> 0 
# Vertex 3: -> 0 

g.remove_edge(0,2)
g.print_graph()
# Vertex 0: -> 3 -> 1 
# Vertex 1: -> 2 -> 0 
# Vertex 2: -> 1 
# Vertex 3: -> 0 
```

## Graph Adjacency Matrix Representation

- An Adjacency Matrix is a 2D array of size V x V where V is the number of nodes in a graph.
- A slot `matrix[i][j] = 1` indicates that there is an edge from node i to node j.

|       | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |
| **1** | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| **2** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| **3** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Pros of Adjacency Matrix
- The basic operations like adding an edge, removing an edge, and checking whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j are extremely time efficient, `O(1)`.
- If the graph is dense and the number of edges is large, an adjacency matrix should be the first choice. Even if the graph and the adjacency matrix is sparse, we can represent it using data structures for sparse matrices.
- The biggest advantage, however, comes from the use of matrices. The recent advances in hardware enable us to perform even expensive matrix operations on the GPU.
- By performing operations on the adjacent matrix, we can get important insights into the nature of the graph and the relationship between its vertices.

### Cons of Adjacency Matrix
- The `VxV` space requirement of the adjacency matrix makes it a memory hog. Graphs out in the wild usually don't have too many connections and this is the major reason why adjacency lists are the better choice for most tasks.
- While basic operations are easy, operations like `inEdges` and `outEdges` are expensive when using the adjacency matrix representation.

```py
class UDG:
    def __init__(self, n):
        # Creates an undirected graph with n vertices [0:n]
        self.n = n
        # Store the graph in the n*n adjacency matrix
        self.adjMatrix = []
        for i in range(n):
            self.adjMatrix.append([0 for i in range(n)])

    def add_edge(self, v1, v2):
        # Adds an edge between vertex1 and vertex2
        if v1 == v2:
            print("Same vertex %d and %d" % (v1, v2))
        self.adjMatrix[v1][v2] = 1 # v1 -> v2
        self.adjMatrix[v2][v1] = 1 # v2 -> v1

    def remove_edge(self, v1, v2):
        # Removes the edge between vertex1 and vertex2
        if self.adjMatrix[v1][v2] == 0:
            print("No edge between %d and %d" % (v1, v2))
            return
        self.adjMatrix[v1][v2] = 0 # v1 -> v2
        self.adjMatrix[v2][v1] = 0 # v2 -> v1

    def print_graph(self):
        for row in self.adjMatrix:
            print(row)

g = UDG(4)
g.print_graph()
# [0, 0, 0, 0]
# [0, 0, 0, 0]
