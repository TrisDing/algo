# Depth-first Search (DFS)

> Depth-first Search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before **backtracking**.

## The Algorithm

1. Pick any node. If it is unvisited, mark it as visited and recur on all its adjacent nodes.
2. Repeat until all the nodes are visited, or the node to be searched is found.

```py
visited = set()

def dfs(node):
    # base case
    if not node:
        return

    if node not in visited:
        # process current node
        print(node.val)

        # add to visited
        visited.add(node)

        # process neighbours
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbour)
```

## Time Complexity

Since all the nodes and vertices are visited, the average time complexity for DFS on a graph is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is `O(V)`, where `V` is the number of nodes.

## DFS Applications

### DFS in a 2D Array

```py
def island(self, grid: List[List[int]]):
    # length of row and column
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # grid[r][c] = 0 => ocean
    # grid[r][c] = 1 => island
    # grid[r][c] = 2 => visited
    def dfs(r, c):
        # base case: grid[r][c] is out of bound
        if not inArea(r, c):
            return

        # current node is ocean, or it's already visited
        if grid[r][c] == 0 or grid[r][c] == 2:
            return

        # mark as visited
        grid[r][c] = 2

        # visit neighbor nodes
        dfs(r+1, c) # UP
        dfs(r-1, c) # DOWN
        dfs(r, c-1) # LEFT
        dfs(r, c+1) # RIGHT

    def inArea(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < m and 0 <= c < n

    for r in range(m):
        for c in range(n):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                # start dfs for each element in grid
                dfs(r, c)
```

### DFS in a Tree

See [Backtrack](<../Chapter%204%20Binary%20Trees/4.6%20Backtrack.md>)

### DFS in a Graph

Given Edges, construct a Graph:
```py
edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]

graph = collections.defaultdict(list) # or defaultdict(set)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v) # u -> v
    graph[v].append(u) # v -> u, add this line if graph is undirected (bi-directional)

graph = { 0: [1,2], 1: [0,2], 2: [1,0] } # UDG
graph = { 0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0] } # DG
```

Given an **undirected graph** (or **bidirectional graph**) with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex `start` to vertex `end`.
```py
def validPath(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> bool:
    visited = set()

    def dfs(u):
        if u == end:
            return True

        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                if dfs(v):
                    return True

        return False

    return dfs(start)
```

Given a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, find all possible paths from node `start` to node `end` and return them in any order.
```py
def allPathsSourceToTarget(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    res = []
    
    # no need to track visited node because of acyclic

    def dfs(u, path):
        if u == end:
            res.append(path[:])
            return

        for v in graph[u]:
            dfs(v, path + [v]) # backtrack

    dfs(start, [start])
    return res
```

Given a **directed graph** with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Determine whether all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`.
```py
def allPathsLeadsToDestination(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
    # 0: unvisited
    # 1: visiting (visited in the current ongoing path)
    # 2: visited
    visited = defaultdict(int)

    def dfs(u):
        # visited
        if visited[u] == 2:
            return True

        # visiting u again on the path, meaning this Graph has circle
        if visited[u] == 1:
            return False

        # unvisited
        if len(graph[u]) == 0: # u is the end vertex
            return u == destination # is u the destination?

        visited[u] = 1 # visiting u
        for v in graph[u]:
            if not dfs(v):
                return False
        visited[u] = 2 # visited u

        return True

    return dfs(source)
```
