# Depth-first Search (DFS)

> Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

## The Algorithm

1. Pick any node. If it is unvisited, mark it as visited and recur on all its adjacent nodes.
2. Repeat until all the nodes are visited, or the node to be searched is found.

```py
visited = set()

def dfs(node):
    # base case
    if not node:
        return

    if node not in visited:
        # process current node
        print(node.val)

        # add to visited
        visited.add(node)

        # process neighbours
        for neighbour in graph[node]:
            dfs(neighbour)
```

## Time Complexity

Since all the nodes and vertices are visited, the average time complexity for DFS on a graph is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges. In case of DFS on a tree, the time complexity is `O(V)`, where `V` is the number of nodes.

## DFS Applications

**DFS in a 2D Array**
```py
""" The Island Problem """
def island(self, grid: List[List[int]]):
    # length of row and column
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # grid[r][c] = 0 => ocean
    # grid[r][c] = 1 => island
    # grid[r][c] = 2 => visited
    def dfs(r, c):
        # base case: grid[r][c] is out of bound
        if not inArea(r, c):
            return

        # current node is ocean, or it's already visited
        if grid[r][c] == 0 or grid[r][c] == 2:
            return

        # mark as visited
        grid[r][c] = 2

        # visit neighbor nodes
        dfs(r+1, c) # UP
        dfs(r-1, c) # DOWN
        dfs(r, c-1) # LEFT
        dfs(r, c+1) # RIGHT

    def inArea(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < m and 0 <= c < n

    for r in range(m):
        for c in range(n):
            if grid[r][c] == 1:
                # start dfs for each element in grid
                dfs(r, c)

**DFS in a Graph**

Given edges, construct graph
```py
edges: List[List[int]] = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]]

graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v) # u -> v
    graph[v].append(u) # v -> u, undirected (bi-directional) add this line
```

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, find all possible paths from node `start` to node `end` and return them in any order.
```py
def allPathsSourceTarget(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(graph)
    res = []

    def dfs(u, path):
        if u == end:
            res.append(path[:])
            return

        for v in graph[u]:
            # no need to track visited node because of acyclic
            dfs(v, path + [v]) # backtrack

    dfs(start, [start])
    return res
```

Given a **undirected graph** (or bi-directional graph) with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Determine if there is a valid path that exists from vertex `start` to vertex `end`.
```py
def validPath(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int) -> bool:
    visited = set()

    def dfs(u):
        if u == end:
            return True

        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                visited.add(v)
                if dfs(v):
                    return True

        return False

    return dfs(start)
```

Given a **directed graph** with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually, end at `destination`.
```py
def leadsToDestination(self, n: int, graph: List[List[int]], source: int, destination: int) -> bool:
    # 0: unvisited
    # 1: visiting (visited in the current ongoing path)
    # 2: visited
    visited = defaultdict(int)

    def dfs(u):
        if visited[u] == 2: # visited
            return True
        if visited[u] == 1: # Graph has circle
            return False
        if len(graph[u]) == 0:
            return u == destination
        visited[u] = 1
        for v in graph[u]:
            if not dfs(v):
                return False
        visited[u] = 2
        return True

    return dfs(source)
