# Topological Sort

> Topological Sort provides a linear sorting based on the required ordering between vertices in **directed acyclic graphs (DAG)**. To be specific, given vertices `u` and `v`, to reach vertex `v`, we must have reached vertex `u` first. In topological sort, `u` has to appear before `v` in the ordering.

- Topological sort only works with graphs that are directed and acyclic.
- There must be at least one vertex in the graph with an _in-degree_ of `0`. If all vertices in the graph have a non-zero _in-degree_, then all vertices need at least one vertex as a predecessor. In this case, no vertex can serve as the starting vertex.

## Kahn's Algorithm

Kahn's algorithm is a simple topological sort algorithm can find a topological ordering in `O(V+E)` time.

The intuition behind Kahn's algorithm is to repeatedly remove nodes without any dependencies from the graph and add them to the topological ordering. As nodes without dependencies (and their outgoing edges) are removed from the graph, new nodes without dependencies should become free. We repeat removing nodes without dependencies from the graph until all nodes are processed, or a cycle is discovered.

```py
def findTopologicalOrdering(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    # Given edges, construct the graph and in-degree array
    # edge = [u, v], u -> v, v is depend on u (in order to visite v, we must first visit u)
    graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
    inDegrees = [0] * len(edges)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v) # u -> v
        inDegrees[v] += 1

    noDependencies = [u for u in range(n) if inDegrees[u] == 0]
    queue = collections.deque(noDependencies)
    res = []

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        res.append(u)

        for v in graph[u]:
            inDegrees[v] -= 1 # u is visited, so remove 1 dependency from v
            if inDegrees[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)

    if len(res) != n:
        return [] # no such ordering

    return res
```
