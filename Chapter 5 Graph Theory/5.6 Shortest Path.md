# Shortest Path

> Breadth-first search algorithm can only solve the shortest path problem in **unweighted graphs**. But we often need to find the shortest path in a **weighted graph**.

There are two **single source** and **shortest path** algorithms:
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** (solve weighted directed graph with **non-negative weights**).
- **Bellman-Ford Algorithm** (solve weighted directed graph with any weights, including **negative weights**).

## Dijkstra's algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm works on the basis that any sub-path `B -> D` of the shortest path `A -> D` between vertices `A` and `D` is also the shortest path between vertices `B` and `D`.

Dijkstra used this property in the opposite direction, that is we overestimate the distance of each vertex from the starting vertex. Then we visit each node and its neighbors to find the shortest sub-path to those neighbors.

The algorithm uses a [Greedy](<../Chapter%207%20Dynamic%20Programming/7.1%20Greedy.md>) approach in the sense that we find the next best solution hoping that the end result is the best solution for the whole problem.

```py
def dijkstra(G, S):
    for each vertex V in G:
        distance[V] <- infinite
        previous[V] <- NULL
        If V != S:
            add V to Priority Queue Q
    distance[S] <- 0

    while Q is not empty:
        U <- extract min from Q
        for each unvisited neighbour V of U:
            tempDistance <- distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V)
            if tempDistance < distance[V]:
                distance[V] <- tempDistance
                previous[V] <- U

    return distance[], previous[]
```

- Time Complexity: `O(E Log V)`
- Space Complexity: `O(V)`

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

Bellman Ford algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but it can work with graphs in which edges can have negative weights. Negative weight edges might seem useless at first, but they can explain a lot of phenomena like cash flow, the heat released/absorbed in a chemical reaction, etc.

Negative weight edges can create negative weight cycles i.e. a cycle that will reduce the total path distance by coming back to the same point. Shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm that aren't able to detect such a cycle can give an incorrect result because they can go through a negative weight cycle and reduce the path length.

```py
def bellmanFord(G, S):
    for each vertex V in G:
        distance[V] <- infinite
        previous[V] <- NULL
    distance[S] <- 0

    for each vertex V in G:
        for each edge (U,V) in G:
            tempDistance <- distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V)
            if tempDistance < distance[V]:
                distance[V] <- tempDistance
                previous[V] <- U

    for each edge (U,V) in G:
        if distance[U] + edge_weight(U, V) < distance[V}
            Error: "Negative Cycle Exists"

  return distance[], previous[]
```
