# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

> A _spanning tree_ is a connected subgraph in an **undirected graph** where all vertices are connected with the minimum number of edges. A _minimum spanning tree_ is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight in a “weighted undirected graph”.

Two algorithms for constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST):
- **Kruskal Algorithm** (by adding edges)
- **Prim Algorithm** (by adding vertices)

```py
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, x, y, cost):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.cost = cost

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.cost < other.cost
```

## Kruskal Algorithm

1. Ascending Sort all edges by their weight
2. Add Edges in that order into Minimum Spanning Tree. Skip the edges that would produce cycles in the MST.
3. Repeat step 2 until `N-1` edges are added.

Given a list of `edges` with cost to connect 2 `points (x, y)`, find min cost to connect all points.
```py
def minCostConnectEdges(self, edges: List[Edge]]) -> int:
    n = len(edges)

    heapq.heapify(edges) # sort edges by cost
    uf = UnionFind(n) # use UnionFind to connect nodes

    res = 0
    count = n - 1 # Need to find exactly n-1 edges
    while edges and count > 0:
        edge = heapq.heappop(edges)
        if not uf.connected(edge.x, edge.y):
            uf.union(edge.x, edge.y)
            res += edge.cost
            count -= 1

    return res
```

## Prim Algorithm

Starting from an arbitrary vertex, Prim's algorithm grows the minimum spanning tree by adding one vertex at a time to the tree. The choice of a vertex is based on the greedy strategy, i.e.,the addition of the new vertex incurs the minimum cost.

Given a list of `edges` with cost to connect 2 `points (x, y)`, find min cost to connect all points.
```py
def minCostConnectEdges(self, edges: List[Edge]]) -> int:
    n = len(edges)

    heapq.heapify(edges) # sort edges by cost
    visited = [False] * n
    visited[0] = True

    res = 0
    count = n - 1 # Need to process exactly N-1 nodes
    while edges and count > 0:
        edge = heapq.heappop(edges)
        x, y, cost = edge.x, edge.y, edge.cost
        if not visited[y]:
            visited[y] = True
            res += cost
            for i in range(n):
                if not visited[i]:
                    cost = abs(points[y][0] - points[i][0]) + abs(points[y][1] - points[i][1])
                    heapq.heappush(edges, Edge(y, i, cost))
            count -= 1

    return res
```
