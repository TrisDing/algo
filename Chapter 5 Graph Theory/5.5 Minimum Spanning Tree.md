# Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

> A _spanning tree_ is a connected subgraph in an **undirected graph** where all vertices are connected with the minimum number of edges. A _minimum spanning tree (MST)_ is a spanning tree with the minimum possible total edge weight in a **weighted undirected graph**.

Two algorithms for constructing a minimum spanning tree (MST):
- **Kruskal Algorithm** (by adding edges)
- **Prim Algorithm** (by adding vertices)

```py
class Edge:
    def __init__(self, x, y, cost):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.cost = cost

    def __lt__(self, other): # for sorting
        return self.cost < other.cost
```

## Kruskal Algorithm

1. Ascending sort all edges by their weight
2. Add edges in that order into the MST using [UnionFind](<./5.2 Disjoint Set>) (skip the edges that would produce cycles).
3. Repeat step 2 until `n-1` edges are added.

Given a list of `edges` with cost to connect 2 `points (x, y)`, find min cost to connect all points.
```py
def minCostConnectEdges(self, edges: List[Edge]]) -> int:
    n = len(edges)
    totalCost = 0

    heapq.heapify(edges) # sort edges by cost
    uf = UnionFind(n) # use UnionFind to connect nodes
    count = n-1 # need to find exactly n-1 edges
    
    while edges and count > 0:
        edge = heapq.heappop(edges)
        if not uf.connected(edge.x, edge.y):
            uf.union(edge.x, edge.y)
            totalCost += edge.cost
            count -= 1

    return totalCost # must be mininum since its sorted
```

## Prim Algorithm

Starting from an arbitrary vertex, Prim algorithm grows the minimum spanning tree by adding one vertex at a time to the tree. The choice of a vertex is based on the greedy strategy, i.e.,the addition of the new vertex incurs the minimum cost.

Given a list of `edges` with cost to connect 2 `points (x, y)`, find min cost to connect all points.
```py
def minCostConnectEdges(self, edges: List[Edge]]) -> int:
    n = len(edges)
    totalCost = 0

    heapq.heapify(edges) # sort edges by cost
    visited = [False] * n
    visited[0] = True

    count = n-1 # need to process exactly N-1 nodes
    while edges and count > 0:
        edge = heapq.heappop(edges)
        x, y, cost = edge.x, edge.y, edge.cost
        if not visited[y]:
            visited[y] = True
            totalCost += cost
            for i in range(n):
                if not visited[i]:
                    cost = abs(points[y][0] - points[i][0]) \
                         + abs(points[y][1] - points[i][1])
                    heapq.heappush(edges, Edge(y, i, cost))
            count -= 1

    return totalCost
```
