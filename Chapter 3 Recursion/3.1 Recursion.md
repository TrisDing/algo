# Recursion

> A recursive function is defined in terms of base cases and recursive steps.

- In a base case, we compute the result immediately given the inputs to the function call.
- In a recursive step, we compute the result with the help of one or more recursive calls to this same function, but with the inputs somehow **reduced** in size or complexity, closer to a base case.

## Factorial
```
n! = n x (n-1) x ... x 2 x 1
```

Iterative Implementation
```py
def factorial(n):
    fact = 1
    for i in range(n):
        fact = fact * i
    }
    return fact
```

Recurrence relation
```
n! = {
    1           if n = 0
    (n-1)! x n  if n > 0
}
```

Recursive Implementation
```py
def factorial(n):
    if n = 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)
```

## Fibonacci
```
fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```

Iterative Implementation
```py
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0: return 0
    if n == 1: return 1

    pre, fib = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n+1):
        pre, fib = fib, pre + fib

    return fib
```

Recurrence relation
```
fib(n) = {
    n                    if n <= 1
    fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)  if n > 1
}
```

Recursive Implementation
```py
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```

## 3 Essentials for recursion

- The recursive step has to transform the problem instance into something **smaller**, otherwise the recursion may never end.
- The steps to solve the larger problem has to be **exactly** the same as smaller sub-problems, so that we can call the same function recursively.
- If every recursive step **shrinks** the problem and the base case lies at the bottom, then the recursion is guaranteed to be finite.
