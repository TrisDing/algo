# Divide & Conquer

> A Divide & Conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining them to get the desired output. To use the divide and conquer algorithm, **recursion** is used.

- **Divide**: Divide the problem into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Conquer**: the sub-problems by solving them recursively. If they are small enough, solve the sub-problems as base cases.
- **Combine**: the solutions to the sub-problems into the solution for the original problem.

```
DivideConquer(problem)
    if problem cannot be divide:
        result = conquer(problem)
        return result

    subproblems = divide(problem)
    res1 = DivideConquer(subproblems[0])
    res2 = DivideConquer(subproblems[1])
    ...

    return combine(res1, res2, ...)
```

Example: Merge Sort
```
      [7 6 1 5 4 3]        DIVIDE
        /       \
    [7 6 1]   [5 4 3]      DIVIDE
     /   \     /   \
   [7 6] [1] [5 4] [3]     DIVIDE
    / \   |   / \   |
   [7][6][1] [5][4][3]     can't DIVIDE any more
   --------------------
   [7][6][1] [5][4][3]     CONQUER (single element is sorted)
   --------------------
    \ /   |   \ /   |
   [6 7] [1] [5 4] [3]     COMBINE
     \   /      \  /
    [1 6 7]   [3 4 5]      COMBINE
        \        /
      [1 3 4 5 6 7]        COMBINE
```

### Time Complexity

```py
T(n) = a * T(n/b) + f(n)
# n = size of input
# a = number of subproblems in the recursion
# n/b = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed to have the same size.
# f(n) = cost of dividing the problem + cost of merging the solutions
```
